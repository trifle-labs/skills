# github-mentions

An [OpenClaw](https://github.com/trifle-labs/openclaw) skill for monitoring and tracking GitHub mentions across your organizations.

## Features

- Uses GitHub Notifications API for reliable mention detection
- Tracks mention status: `pending` → `in_progress` → `completed`
- Configurable filtering (org-only, org-members-only)
- Org member caching with configurable refresh interval
- Prevents duplicate work by tracking what's already being addressed

## Installation

```bash
clawdhub install github-mentions
```

Or manually clone to your skills directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trifle-labs/github-mentions.git ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/github-mentions
```

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- `jq` for JSON processing

## Usage

```bash
# Check for new mentions
github-mentions check

# List all tracked mentions
github-mentions list

# List only pending mentions
github-mentions list pending

# Start working on a mention
github-mentions start owner/repo#123

# Mark a mention as done
github-mentions done owner/repo#123

# View mention details
github-mentions view owner/repo#123

# Show/set configuration
github-mentions config
github-mentions config orgMembersOnly false
```

## Configuration

Default configuration (`config.json`):
```json
{
  "orgOnly": true,
  "orgMembersOnly": true,
  "memberCacheHours": 1,
  "checkIntervalMinutes": 5
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `orgOnly` | `true` | Only track mentions from repos within your orgs |
| `orgMembersOnly` | `true` | Only track mentions from org members |
| `memberCacheHours` | `1` | How often to refresh the org member list |
| `checkIntervalMinutes` | `5` | Reference for intended polling frequency |

## Automated Polling with Cron

Set up a cron job to check for mentions automatically every 5 minutes:

```bash
# Add to crontab (run: crontab -e)
*/5 * * * * /path/to/skills/github-mentions/github-mentions.sh check >> /path/to/logs/github-mentions.log 2>&1
```

Example for OpenClaw workspace:
```bash
*/5 * * * * ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/github-mentions/github-mentions.sh check >> ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/github-mentions.log 2>&1
```

Or use the one-liner to add it:
```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/github-mentions/github-mentions.sh check >> ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/github-mentions.log 2>&1") | crontab -
```

### Alternative: Heartbeat Integration

If using OpenClaw's heartbeat system, add to `HEARTBEAT.md`:
```markdown
- Check GitHub mentions: `github-mentions check`
```

## Workflow

1. Cron/heartbeat runs `github-mentions check` every 5 minutes
2. New mentions appear as `pending`
3. When you start addressing a mention: `github-mentions start owner/repo#123`
4. After responding/resolving: `github-mentions done owner/repo#123`

This prevents the bot from trying to address the same mention multiple times while it's being worked on.
